# README

Family Table is a Ruby on Rails web application designed to allow organization and tracking of meals for an individual or family. Rather than focusing on recipes and product branding, it allows management of food in an accessible way that provides meaning to the user, and strives to make it easier on users to keep track of meals they like to cook and decide on what to make for dinner.  It uses a basic React front-end, and is designed for use with a PostgreSQL database.

This is very much an early work-in-progress. Installation procedure is one of the many missing aspects of this project. Treat this as a code sample for now.
